[![Lines of code](https://tokei.ekzhang.com/b1/github/Szczurox/szczurox.github.io)](https://tokei.ekzhang.com/b1/github/Szczurox/szczurox.github.io)   
My personal site.   

## General info   
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).   
UI is created so that it resembles desktop.   

### Content:
- "Applications" that can be opened by clicking on their shortcut on the desktop
- Working taskbar
- Resizable, draggable windows that can be minimised and opened in fullscreen mode
- Minesweeper minigame
- Console with few commands (use "help" to get a list of commands)   
   
Feel free to use the code in your projects but please credit me, it took me a lot of time to get this site to where it is now and I hope u can respect that.   

## Development future
I plan on making this site serve mainly as my portfolio with some bonuses.   
For now I am focusing mainly on adding new functionalities and fixing UI issues.   
Likely site will have much more content than it has now, because I want it to differ from other portfolio sites
